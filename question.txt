how meta tag works
how the js file works
when we made attr_reader private, specs wouldn't run.  why?  they told us to make our own attr_reader function, how can we make it?

def add_child(child_node)
   unless self.children.include?(child_node)
     child_node.parent = self
     self.children << child_node
   end
end
#why not work
